<p>I am delighted to be able to release three of my original paintings I last exhibited during my successful Footlights solo exhibition held at the prestigious Gallery 8 in St James, London. Previously sold, the original buyers have been unable to complete on the purchase, due to changing personal circumstances and have finally forfeited their deposit. At long last, I am able to offer these wonderful works for sale again.</p>

<h2 style="position:relative;">Private viewing</h2>
If you are interested buying any of these wonderful paintings, I would be delighted to invite you to a private viewing prior to the planned release date. So don’t delay and miss this unique opportunity to own a duffgordon original painting.

    <p>However, before I release these three works to a well-known galley for resale, I am able to offer them for sale directly for a short period and pass on the gallery’s commission directly to the successful buyer.</p>
    <h2>Pre release offer to Footlights visitors and friends</h2>
    <p>
    As an individual who has already shown keen interest in my work, I am pleased to be able to offer you first refusal to buy one these works before they are released for general sale.</p>
