    <h1>DuffGordon original paintings just released for sale</h1>
</header>
<p>I am delighted to announce the release for sale of three my original paintings I last exhibited at my acclaimed Footlights solo exhibition, held at the prestigious Gallery 8 in St. James, London. Previously sold, the original buyers have since been unable to complete on their purchase, due to changing personal circumstances and have finally agreed to forfeit their deposit. At long last, I am able to offer these three wonderful works for sale again.</p>
<h2>Exclusive offer to Footlights visitors and friends</h2>
<p>As an individual who has already shown keen interest in my work, I am pleased to be able to offer you first refusal to buy one these works before they are released for general sale.</p>
<h2>Commission Free Sale</h2>
<p>As you can imagine there has already been some keen interest from the art world. However, before these works are finally released to a well-known galley for resale, I have decided to delay this for a short while and offer them for sale directly to you. I am also prepared to pass on all of the gallery’s commission directly to you in exchange for a prompt sale.</p>
